Dwarves.txt\" 1. Dwarves Name Dwarves (Stoneborn of Thaos) Physical Description Short, broad, and built like walking anvils. Dwarves typically stand 4 to 5 feet tall with dense, heavy bones and thick, muscular frames. Their hair grows in magnificent coils, often decorated with metal rings, runes, or tiny mechanical trinkets. Skin tones range from slate-gray to warm earth-brown, sometimes with subtle mineral flecks — a trait said to come from ancient intermarriage with Crystalkin.\nThaos-specific Humor / Quirks Dwarves insist they don’t have a drinking problem, arguing that ale is simply “hydration with personality.” Common dwarf sayings: “If it wasn’t built to outlive the gods, why build it?” “A dwarf late to a meeting is a sign the meeting wasn’t worth going to.” “I don’t hold grudges.
