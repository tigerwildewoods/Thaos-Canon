### SIGIL GENERATION PROMPT  
**Myth Cycle:** War of Ink and Stone  
**Sigil Name:** The Sundering Script

Create a **high-complexity SVG-ready sigil** in the THAOS master style:

- Intricate knotwork forming the outer boundary  
- Inner rings structured around thematic geometry matching the Myth Cycle  
- Three layers of embedded runic script (outer / middle / core)  
- A recognizable central glyph expressing the essence of **The Sundering Script**  
- Subtle asymmetry and mirroring to reflect mythic duality  
- Heavy use of sacred curves, angled quill-lines, and deep symmetry

**Rendering Requirements**  
- Black-on-transparent linework  
- No shading, no gradients  
- Clean strokes suitable for vectorization  
- Include negative-space motifs tied to the cycle’s archetypal symbolism

**Symbolic Directives for This Sigil**  
- Express The Sundering Script as a primordial archetype  
- Encode mythic tension (creation vs dissolution / memory vs forgetting / boundary vs threshold depending on cycle)  
- Use cycle-aligned runes:  
    • *Primordial Dawn:* spirals, seeds, radiance  
    • *Titan Fables:* monolithic forms, weight, pressure  
    • *Veil & Void:* emptiness, thresholds, thin lines, negative space  
    • *Ember & Ash:* heat fracture patterns, rising curves  
    • *Tides of Memory:* flowing sigils, wave arcs  
    • *War of Ink & Stone:* chiseling glyphs, calligraphic strokes  
    • *Chorus of Winds:* harmonics, arcs, spirals  
    • *Threads of Destiny:* braids, interwoven lines, branching points

The sigil should feel ancient, sacred, and technical—equal parts myth and diagram.
